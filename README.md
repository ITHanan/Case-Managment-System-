Case Management System

(Ärendehanteringssystem)

Project Idea (Scenario):
The project involves developing a Case Management System (CMS) that helps organizations manage and track various types of cases in a structured and efficient way. The system will be web-based and offer features such as case creation, assignment, status tracking, notifications, and report generation.

Background and Purpose (in simple terms):
Many companies and organizations handle cases in a complicated way—either manually or through disorganized systems. This leads to longer processing times, confusion, and difficulty in tracking progress.

A digital case management system can solve these problems by:

Automating workflows so that cases are handled faster
Making it easier for users to collaborate
Ensuring that all cases are processed correctly according to rules and guidelines
The goal of the project is to create a modern, secure, and user-friendly platform that helps organizations work more efficiently and maintain high-quality case management.

Vision & Goals
Vision / Problem Statement:
The solution should be a simple, seamless, and secure system for case management. It should help organizations create, track, and resolve cases in an organized manner. The system aims to reduce manual work, improve communication between users, and ensure that all cases are handled correctly and on time.

The system is designed for companies, government agencies, and other organizations that deal with a high volume of cases, such as customer service teams, HR departments, and support teams. By centralizing all cases in one place and automating parts of the workflow, the system will make case management faster, easier, and more efficient, saving time and improving service quality.
